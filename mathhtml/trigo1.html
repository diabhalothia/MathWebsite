<h1><a id="trig">MORE ABOUT TRIGNOMETRY </a></h1><br/>
Trigonometry (from Greek trigonon, "triangle" + metron, "measure"[1]) is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and anglesof triangles. The field emerged during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.[2]
The 3rd century astronomers first noted that the lengths of the sides of a right angle triangle and the angles between those sides have fixed relationships: that is, if at least the length of one side and the value of one angle is known all other angles and lengths can be determined algorithmically. These calculations soon came to be defined as the trigonometric functions and today are pervasive in both pure and appliedmathematics: fundamental methods of analysis such as the Fourier Transform, for example, or the wave equation, use trigonometric functions to understand cyclical phenomena across a great many applications in fields as diverse as physics, mechanical and electrical engineering, music and acoustics, astronomy, ecology and biology. Trigonometry is also the foundation of the practical art of surveying.
Trigonometry is most simply associated with planar right angle triangles (a two dimensional triangle with one angle equal to 90 degrees). The applicability to non-right angle triangles exists but, since any non-right angle triangle (on a flat plane) can be bisected to create two right angle triangles, most problems can be reduced to calculations on right angle triangles. Thus the majority of applications relates to right angle triangles. One exception to this is Spherical trigonometry, the study of triangles on spheres, surfaces of constant positive curvature, in elliptic geometry (a fundamental part ofastronomy and navigation). Trigonometry on surfaces of negative curvature is part of hyperbolic geometry.
Trigonometry basics are often taught in school either as a separate course or as part of a precalculus course.

<h2>Applications of trigonometry</h2>
 
 <br/>
Sextants are used to measure the angle of the sun or stars with respect to the horizon. Using trigonometry and amarine chronometer, the position of the ship can be determined from such measurements.
Main article: Uses of trigonometry
There are an enormous number of uses of trigonometry and trigonometric functions. For instance, the technique of triangulation is used in astronomy to measure the distance to nearby stars, in geography to measure distances between landmarks, and in satellite navigation systems. The sine and cosine functions are fundamental to the theory of periodic functions such as those that describe sound and light waves.
Fields that use trigonometry or trigonometric functions include astronomy (especially for locating apparent positions of celestial objects, in which spherical trigonometry is essential) and hence navigation (on the oceans, in aircraft, and in space), music theory, audio synthesis, acoustics, optics, analysis of financial markets, electronics, probability theory, statistics, biology, medical imaging (CAT scans and ultrasound), pharmacy, chemistry, number theory(and hence cryptology), seismology, meteorology, oceanography, many physical sciences, land surveying and geodesy, architecture, phonetics,economics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer graphics, cartography, crystallography and game development.
