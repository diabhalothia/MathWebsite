<b>Arithmetic Sequence:
In an Arithmetic Sequence the difference between one term and the next is a constant.
In other words, we just add the same value each time ... infinitely.</b>
<br/><br/>
Example:-<br/>
1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, ...
This sequence has a difference of 3 between each number. 
In General we could write an arithmetic sequence like this:
<br/>

{a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ... }<br/>
where:
<br/>
a is the first term, and 
d is the difference between the terms (called the "common difference")<br/>

Example: (continued):-
1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, ...<br/>
Has:
a = 1 (the first term)
d = 3 (the "common difference" between terms)<br/>
And we get:<br/>
{a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ... }<br/>
{1, 1+3, 1+2×3, 1+3×3, ... }<br/>
{1, 4, 7, 10, ... }<br/></br>
<b>Rule</b>
We can write an Arithmetic Sequence as a rule:
xn = a + d(n-1)
(We use "n-1" because d is not used in the 1st term).<br/>
<img src="ap2.gif" align="right">
Example: Write the Rule, and calculate the 4th term for:-
3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, ...<br/>
<b>solution</b><br/>
This sequence has a difference of 5 between each number.
The values of a and d are:<br/>
a = 3 (the first term),
d = 5 (the "common difference")<br/>
The Rule can be calculated:
xn = a + d(n-1)
= 3 + 5(n-1) 
= 3 + 5n - 5 
= 5n - 2
So, the 4th term is:
x4 = 5×4 - 2 = 18<br/>
<b>Arithmetic Sequences are sometimes called Arithmetic Progressions (A.P.’s)</b><br/>
Summing an Arithmetic Series:-
To sum up the terms of this arithmetic sequence:</br>
a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + ... =n/2(2a+(n-1)d)
 It is called Sigma Notation.<br/>
Here is how to use it:<br/>
<img src="ap20.gif" align="right">
Example: Add up the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence:
{ 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ... }<br/>
The values of a, d and n are:
a = 1 (the first term),
d = 3 (the "common difference" between terms),
n = 10 (how many terms to add up).
So:10/2(2.1 + (10 - 1)3)
 
Becomes:
 
= 5(2+9•3) = 5(29) = 145<br/>
<b>Why Does the Formula Work?</b>

I want to show you why the formula works, because we get to use an interesting "trick" which is worth knowing.
First, we will call the whole sum "S":<br/>
S = a + (a + d) + ... + (a + (n-2)d) + (a + (n-1)d) <br/>
Next, rewrite S in reverse order:<br/>
S = (a + (n-1)d) + (a + (n-2)d) + ... + (a + d) + a<br/>
Now add those two, term by term:<br/>
S	=	a	+	(a+d)	+	...	+	(a + (n-2)d)	+	(a + (n-1)d)<br/>
S	=	(a + (n-1)d)	+	(a + (n-2)d)	+	...	+	(a + d)	+	a<br/>
										
2S	=	(2a + (n-1)d)	+	(2a + (n-1)d)	+	...	+	(2a + (n-1)d)	+	(2a + (n-1)d)<br/>
Each term is the same! And there are "n" of them so ...
2S = n × (2a + (n-1)d) <br/>
Now, just divide by 2 and we get:
S = (n/2) × (2a + (n-1)d) 
Which is our formula

<br/>
An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant.
For example, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is is an arithmetic progression with common difference 1.
Second example: the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,... is an arithmetic progression<br/>
with common difference 2.<br/>
Third example: the sequence 20, 10, 0, -10, -20, -30, ... is an arithmetic progression<br/>
with common difference -10.<br/>
<b>Notation</b><br/>
We denote by d the common difference.
By an we denote the n-th term of an arithmetic progression.
By Sn we denote the sum of the first n elements of an arithmetic series.
Arithmetic series means the sum of the elements of an arithmetic progression.
Properties<br/>
a1 + an = a2 + an-1 = ... = ak + an-k+1<br/>
and<br/>
an = ½(an-1 + an+1)<br/>
Sample: let 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51... be an arithmetic progression.<br/>
51 + 1 = 41 + 11 = 31 + 21<br/>
and
11 = (21 + 1)/2><br/>
21 = (31 + 11)/2...<br/>
If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is a1 and the common difference of successive members is d, then the n-th term of the sequence is given by
an = a1 + (n - 1)d, n = 1, 2, ...<br/>
The sum S of the first n numbers of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:
S = ½(a1 + an)n<br/>
where a1 is the first term and an the last one.
or<br/>
S = ½(2a1 + d(n-1))n<br/>
